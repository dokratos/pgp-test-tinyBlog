PGP code review test in mob

Purpose
You are going to create a blog that connects to this https://dummyjson.com/posts. Your blog only shows different posts. But the important thing is that you need to have sections for the different posts. 
Requirements
Display the posts as a list of cards. With a clear paragraph body and title for each card. 
The tags should be displayed at the bottom of the card.
It should display 5 different sections. These are based on the “tags” value you get from the API. You decide yourself which 5 tags you wanna show.
The sections should be clearly separated from each other, and it should be clear which one is which.
You should have a dropdown for each section. So you can show and hide the posts for each section.
Everything should be in React with TypeScript!
